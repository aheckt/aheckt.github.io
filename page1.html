		<p>Below are some of my most recent watches</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><b><i>Sicario</i>(2015)</b></p>
				<hr />
				<p>Denis Villeneuve's style and techniques are a major highlight of this film. It features some beautiful wide shots and aerial shots, and the color grading adds another layer, serving as a storytelling tool while also capturing the essence the American southwest and Mexico. On top of that, Johannsson's score was enthralling and really added to the already tense atmosphere. The story itself was very intense at times, and still paced well enough to be entertaining throughout. Unlike many other on-screen portrayals of the war on drugs, this one offers a refreshingly honest, albeit somewhat depressing perspective that is sure to leave a lasting impact on me. <b>4.5/5</b> </p>
			</li>

				<p><b><i>Casablanca</i>(1942)</b></p>
				<hr />
				<p>I finally got around to watching this critically acclaimed classic. With as much hype as it has, I was honestly expecting to be a bit let down. To my surprise, this film kept me absolutely hooked throughout its runtime. The political allegory and engaging conflict made what might otherwise be a slow or boring film into an immersive experience. Though I think the romantic elements are overstated by critics, the writing and dialogue was top tier, and a lot funnier than I expected. <b>5/5</b></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b><i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>(2022)</b></p>
				<hr />
				<p>Wow. This film had me in awe. The plot intricately weaves themes of personal identity, family, love, mortality, and the nature of reality. It has a lot on its plate, but still manages to deliver a nuanced and thought-provoking result. What stood out to me the most was the editing. It is ridiculously stunning and adds so much weight to the story. This film could not have been made five years ago and in my opinion is the apex of modern storytelling. <b>5/5</b> </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b><i>Glass Onion(2022)</i></b></p>
				<hr />
				<p>It's hard to deny my disappointment with this movie. As a sequel to the wildly successful Knives Out, I was expecting a thrilling and intellectually engaging mystery with intricate plot details, clever twists, and plenty of tension. Unfortunately, what I got was a lackluster plot and cringeworthy dialouge that came off as pretentious, out of touch, and phoned in. It relied heavily on a stacked cast, expensive sets, and lots of gimmicks, losing all of the charm of the original. <b>1.5/5</b></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
