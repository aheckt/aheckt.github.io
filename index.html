	<h1>What is the purpose of this website?</h1>
	<p>I've created this page to share my passions with you and keep you in the loop about what's been keeping me busy!</p>
	<p>If you're a friend or family member with whom I haven't had the chance to regularly communicate with, or simply someone who shares my interests and wants to get to know me better, you've landed in the right spot!</p>
