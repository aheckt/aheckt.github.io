		<p>Below are some of my most recent reads</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<p> <b><i>Notes from Underground</i>(1864)</b></p>
				<hr />
				<p>My introduction to Dostoevsky. This is a quick read and from what I've heard a good introduction to his work. I found it to be a captivating dive into the pychology of a bitter, isolated man and his attempts to connect with others. </p>

			<li>
				<p> <b> <i>Crime and Punishment</i>(1866)</b> </p>
				<hr />
				<p>After finishing <i>Notes from Underground</i> I delved into one of Dostoevsky's most notable works. Like its predecessor, this novel offers a profound pychological exploration of its characters, delivering a thought provoking and haunting story. While it can be slow and droning in parts, the novel is still engaging, featuring some memorable characters.  </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> <b><i>Nudge</i>(2008)</b></p>
				<hr />
				<p> A required read for my Behavioral Economics class, this book explores how individuals and governments can use small behavioral interventions, or "nudges", to promote better decision-making and improve outcomes. I got a lot of enjoyment out of this. It was easy to follow and featured countless fascinating examples of "nudges" in practice. </p>
